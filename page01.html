    <div id="mainhead"><h1>Data Science</h1></div>
    <div id="part1"><p>Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms,  and 
        systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
        Data science is much more than simply analyzing data. It offers a range of  roles and requires a 
        range of skills.As an academic discipline and  profession, data science continues to evolve as one of the most 
        promising  and  in-demand  career  paths  for  skilled  professionals.  Today,  successful  data 
        professionals  understand  that  they  must  advance  past  the  traditional  skills  of  analyzing  large 
        amounts of data, data mining, and programming skills. </p></div>
    <br><div id="part2"><p>Data can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, 
            which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing, by human or electronic 
            machines. It can be described as unprocessed facts and figures. It is represented with the help of 
            characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+, -, /, *, <,>, =, etc.). 
           <br> Whereas information  is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based. It is data that 
            has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the recipient and is of real or perceived value 
            in the current or the prospective  action or decision of recipient. Furtherer more, information is 
            interpreted data; created from organized, structured, and processed data in a particular context.</p></div>

          <div id="h2"><h2>Data Processing Cycle</h2></div>
            <br><div id="part3"><p>Data processing is the re-structuring or re-ordering of data by people or machines to increase their 
            usefulness and add values for a particular purpose. Data processing consists of the following basic
            steps - input, processing, and output. These three steps constitute the data processing cycle.<br>•  Input − in this step, the input data is prepared in some convenient form for processing. The 
            form will depend on the processing machine. For example, when electronic computers are used, the input data can be recorded on any one of the several types of storage medium, 
            such as hard disk, CD, flash disk and so on.<br>•  Processing − in this step, the input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form. 
            For example, interest can be calculated on deposit to a bank, or a summary of sales for the 
            month can be calculated from the sales orders.
            <br>•  Output −  at  this  stage,  the  result  of  the  proceeding  processing  step  is  collected.  The 
            particular form of the output data depends on the use of the data. For example, output data 
            may be payroll for employees. </p></div>
