    <div id="mainhead"><h1>Data types from Data Analytics perspective</h1></div>
    <div id="part1"><p>From a data analytics point of view, it is important to understand that there are three common types 
        of  data  types  or  structures:<div id="ki"> <br> Structured, <br> Semi-structured,  and  <br>Unstructured  data  types.</div>  </p></div>
        <div id="h2"><h2>Structured Data</h2></div>
        <div id="part2"><p>Structured data is data that adheres to a pre-defined data model and is therefore straightforward to 
            analyze. Structured data conforms to a tabular format with a relationship between the different 
            rows and columns. Common examples of structured data are Excel files or SQL databases. Each 
            of these has structured rows and columns that can be sorted.</p></div>

            <div id="h3"><h2>Semi-structured Data</h2></div>
            <div id="part3"><p>Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure 
                of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless, 
                contains tags or  other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records 
                and fields within the data. Therefore, it is also known as a self-describing structure. Examples of 
                semi-structured data include JSON and XML are forms of semi-structured data.</p></div>
                <img src="09.jpg">
                <div id="h4"><h2>Unstructured Data</h2></div>
                <div id="part4"><p>Unstructured  data  is  information  that  either  does  not  have  a  predefined  data  model  or  is  not 
                    organized  in  a  pre-defined  manner.  Unstructured  information  is  typically  text-heavy  but  may 
                    contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that  make  it  difficult  to  understand  using  traditional  programs  as  compared  to  data  stored  in 
                    structured databases. Common examples of unstructured data include audio, video files or NoSQL databases.</p></div>
